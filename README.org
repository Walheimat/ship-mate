This package tries to marry packages =project= and =compile=.

** Installation

If you use =straight= or =quelpa=, you know what to do.

If you're on Emacs >29, I recommend using =package-vc-install=.

Alternatively, provided you have Cask, you can install the package
with =make package-install= after initializing the submodule =dinghy=.

** Usage

Here's a =use-package= configuration example.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  :config
  ;; Create common commands.
  (ship-mate-create-command build :default "make")
  (ship-mate-create-command install :default "make install")
  (ship-mate-create-command clean :default "make clean")
  (ship-mate-create-command execute)
  (ship-mate-create-command test :default '("make test" "make coverage"))

  ;; This mode sets up `compilation-start' and `recompile' to play
  ;; nice with commands created above.

#+end_src

*** Creating commands

The first step is to create new =ship-mate= commands using macro
=ship-mate-create-command=. Let's create one for testing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ship-mate-create-command test)
#+end_src

This will create command =ship-mate-test=. This command wraps
=compile= but providing it a project-scoped history. On first
invocation (assuming you call it from a buffer belonging to a
project) this will prompt because there is no history and no default
command.

We could have used the following instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ship-mate-create-command test :default "make test")
#+end_src

We'd no longer be prompted when running =ship-mate-test= for the first
time. The =:default= here will be the first entry in the history for
all projects. You can also pass multiple defaults.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ship-mate-create-command test :default ("make test" "make test-all"))
#+end_src

If you run the command with =C-u= (the universal argument) you will be
instead prompted from the history. In our last example, the history
would contain the two defined commands. If you enter a different
command it will be added to the history.

This history is the history of the command /for/ the project. Projects
/do/ inherit the default but not the history created through usage.

While setting defaults this way is useful, you may want to use
different entries for different projects. You can do so by setting the
appropriate variable in a =.dir-locals.el= file.

#+begin_src lisp-data
((nil . ((ship-mate-test-default-cmd . ("make test"
                                        "make test-tagged"
                                        "make test-selector"
                                        "make test-coverage")))))
#+end_src

This would prep the history with four entries for this project
(assuming the =.dir-locals.el= file exists at project root). Once a
history exists you can also store it directly by calling
=ship-mate-store-history-as-default=.

The commands created in this way are automatically bound in map
=ship-mate-command-map=. In our case since we didn't specify a key, it
would be bound to =t= in the map since the initial is =t=.

Since this might lead to clashes, you can also specify the key
yourself using =:key=. The value here is passed as-is to =define-key=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ship-mate-create-command test)
(ship-mate-create-command tag :key "g")
#+end_src

*** Using commands

Beyond providing a per-project history, =ship-mate= commands also set
the =compilation-save-buffers-predicate= to make sure you're only
prompted to save buffers belonging to the project.

Provided you enable =ship-mate-dinghy-global-mode= you will also
notice a header line. This header line is set by
=ship-mate-dinghy-mode=. Its purpose is to bind commands and to show
additional information like the currently used environment variables.
You can disable this by setting =ship-mate-dinghy-enable= to =nil=.

Provided you enable =ship-mate-mode= this package advises =recompile=
and =project-compile= to offer the same benefits when running it (from
within or without a compilation buffer). In fact, these two commands
are the defaults in =ship-mate-compile-functions= which you may want
to customize.

You can also use =ship-mate-with-project-bounded-compilation= to
advise functions yourself using advice combinator =:around=.

=ship-mate= uses the function in
=ship-mate-command-fuzzy-match-function= to check if a command belongs
to the history of a =ship-mate= command and to also update the history
when using =recompile= or =compile= instead. For normal
=ship-mate-command= invocations entries in the history are also
replaced instead of pushed out for good matches. You can check the
behavior using =ship-mate-show-logs= (provided =ship-mate-log= is
=t=).

From a =ship-mate= command buffer you can use
=ship-mate-command-{next,prev}-buffer= to quickly switch between
command buffers of the same project (they're also bound in
=ship-mate-dinghy-mode=).

*** Setting the environment

If you use environment variables, you can set =ship-mate-environment=
in your =.dir-locals.el=. The value of this variable will be used to
set =compilation-environment= and is safe to set (checked by
=ship-mate-environment--valid-env-p=). The initial value is local to
the project.

You can also set an environment per command by using an association
list where the key is the command symbol and the value a list
considered valid by =ship-mate-environment--valid-env-p=.

You can also run a =ship-mate= command with numeric prefix 5 (or
whatever =ship-mate-edit-environment-prefix= is set to) to edit the
environment in the minibuffer before executing it. This also works for
recompilation.

*** Hiding and resurfacing compilations

Sub-package =ship-mate-submarine= provides commands to temporarily
hide running compilations or run them pre-hidden.  Enable
=ship-mate-submarine-mode= for this.

You can now use command =ship-mate-submarine-hidden-recompile= which
will run =recompile= but not display the buffer until the compilation
has finished. After compilation and idle time of
=ship-mate-submarine-prompt-for-hidden-buffer= seconds, you will be
prompted to view the result. If you don't mind a sudden pop-up as soon
as compilation finishes instead you can set
=ship-mate-submarine-prompt-for-hidden-buffer= to =nil=.

In the same way you can now type =C-c /= or call
=ship-mate-submarine-hide= in a running =ship-mate= buffer to send it
to the background and make it prompt when finished. From outside you
can call =ship-mate-submarine-hide-visible= to submerge a visible
compilation (bound to =C-c ?= in the command map).

You can also now run any =ship-mate= command with numeric prefix 3 (or
whatever =ship-mate-submarine-hidden-compilation-prefix= is set to) to
run it submerged from the beginning.

To show a currently hidden compilation you can run
=ship-mate-submarine-show-hidden= which will prompt you with a
selection of submerged processes.

*** Editing the environment and history

Sub-package =ship-mate-edit= provides commands
=ship-mate-edit-environment= and =ship-mate-edit-history= to
conveniently edit the environment or command history in a buffer,
apply the changes (if they're valid) or clear them.

You may want to run =ship-mate-edit-setup-bindings= to create bindings
in =ship-mate-command-map= and =ship-mate=dinghy-mode-map=.
